## Research Question
(from Sep. 6 slideshow): What factors pushed Black and white migrants to the US South in the late 20th century? What parts of the south did they go to? What factors attracted Black and white migrants from the North to Southern destinations?

> > - from **Abstract** section: "Commonly used classifications of return and nonreturn migrants, based on birthplace and previous residence, do not accurately reflect the extent of familial and social ties behind recent Black migration to the southern United States. Analysis of the household context of individual migration confirms evidence from in-depth interviews with migrants that thousands of Black children and adults born outside the South are moving to the region as part of return migration. A reinterpretation of migration categories underscores social trends of overriding importance in explaining destination choices."
> > - This article delineates the migration pattern of Black Americans between 1975-1980, particularly their choice of return migration to the South or to stay in the North. The large shift to return back to their previous origin after occupying residence in the North can be attributed to what is described as return migration and is the result of favorable employment trends due to the expansive manufacturing landscape and growth in service-sector jobs. Researchers found that the highest concentration of Black Americans migrating back to the South has been in metropolitan areas, and locations in close proximity that once had the greatest movement to the North.

> > - "The immediate cause of the interregional population shifts is fairly heavy net out-migration from the Northeast and North Central regions to the South and West, combined with birth rates that are near historical low levels. Interactive relationships that cause employment growth and migration to reinforce one another are probably operating, but these relationships are not well understood. They are the focus of this paper."
> > - Similar to the article based on Myrdial's theory, Northern migration had a direct link to the rising economic success within the Black community and increasing wages. In the early 20th century, The Southern economy was characterized by low wages, intensive labor, and agricultural dependence. This economy made Black Americans resource dependent and did not allow them to branch out into opportunities that would be substantially more profitable. Simultaneously, the urbanization and industrialization of the North allowed for efficient and increased output, creating lucrative ventures for the Black community. As masses migrated to the North, workers unionized and the Black population had the first opportunity to mobilize themselves into an organized work force. Thus, economic growth during this time can be linked directly to migration of the Black community.
> > - Focuses closely on the ramifactions of the shift from agriculture, in the South, to industrialized work, in the North.
> > - An increased number of workers also contributes heavily to the amount of output that can be produced and thus, the aggregate income of the Black community. As more funds are obtained by Black workers, systems such as education, which coincide with economic success, greatly increase.

> > - "whether regional changes in the United States have made the South a more favorable destination than it once was, especially for [Black people]"
> > > - Hunt et al. (2008) postulate that the South may be a more favorable destination due to industrailization, which meant that "the South may be increasingly seen as a 'land of promise' where new opportunities can be pursued and past traditions reclaimed." They believe that part of the new attractiveness of the South could be a desire to pursue economic opportunities (following industrializiation) and the chance to "reclaim historical space occupied by their ancestors."

> > > - "For [White people], it is easy to argue that historical advantages from one place are simply transferred to a new one. For [Black people], this same argument did not hold historically..."
> > - Hunt et al. (2008) suggest that the primary reasons for these migrations to the South (in this article, the authors insist on the concept of a "New South" characterized by industrialization) were economic opportunity and cultural ties. As these perceptions of these factors fluctuate, so may migration of different racial groups to the region.

> > > - (1) differences in trends in state corporate income taxes: "Beginning in the early 1950s the relative tax rate for several southern states... began to decline sharply. On the other hand, relative tax rates for three divisions, New England, the East North Central and the Mid-Atlantic, rose in the early sixties."
> > > - (2) a more favorable business climate in the South, with regard to "the division of power between union and management in the collective bargaining process."
> > > - (3) unionization: "Movement to the South is, therefore, seen as a flight from high-union states."
> > - "Have these three factors been important in determining the direction and magnitude of inter-state migration of industry? and Are there systematic reasons for differences between industries in the degree to which these factors affect migration decisions?"
> > - This paper explores the economic theory behind how the state corporate income tax, business climates, and unionization can become economic incentives or disincentives for migration.

> - **Summary/Important Points**
> > - Following the publication of Gunnar Myrdal's 'An American Dilemma,' "The 'Myrdal Effect on Black Economic Advancement' theory posits that a remarkable transformation occurred in the economic landscape for Black Americans in the mid-20th century. This theory is substantiated by a comprehensive empirical study that examines the racial inequality and discrimination faced by Black Americans during this time period, in the context of economics, education, and social opportunities comparable to their white counterparts>
> > - After Myrdal's influential publication, a wave of transformative changes swept through the United States, marked by the enactment of civil rights legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These legislative measures were designed to dismantle institutionalized segregation focusing specifically on the reduction of disproportionate wages between Black and white Americans. This shift in economic equality can be attributed to two key factors: education and geographical location. Through improved access to education and strategic geographical mobility, Black Americans were able to secure better economic prospects, ultimately contributing to the gradual closure of the wage gap between Black and white populations and the rise of their upward mobility.
> > - From this, the theory of education as a catalyst for economic growth emerges. As Black individuals began to attain higher levels of education, such as high school diplomas, college degrees, or advanced degrees, they increased their earning potential significantly. Researchers reported that in 1940, after education improved in the black community, Black men were earning 50-55% as much as a white worker, and 70-80% in the 1980s and thereafter. This phenomenon is often observed as a narrowing of the wage gap between Black and white workers with similar levels of education. Educational attainment provided access to better job opportunities, higher-paying positions, and increased job security, all of which contributed to improved economic prospects for Black individuals. It can be asserted that education in the Black community has transformative ramifications on average wages.
> > - Northward migration also became a leading cause in the increase of wages for Black Americans. Starting in 1910 and increasing exponentially in the 1940s, the Great Migration played a pivotal role in raising Black wages and improving economic prospects. Southern states were characterized by Jim Crow laws, racial segregation, and limited economic opportunities for Black individuals as they were often financially dependent on low bearing land and economically tied to sharecroppers. In contrast, the northern states were experiencing industrialization and urbanization, which created a growing demand for labor in factories, industries, and urban settings. As Black people moved northward, they entered an industrialized workforce as opposed to the South, that was technologically behind and characterized with low agricultural output. The influx of Black workers into northern cities also contributed to the growth of labor unions and the emergence of a more organized labor force. This led to improved working conditions and higher wages for many Black workers. Additionally, the increased demand for labor in the North created competition among employers for workers, which further pushed up wages.
