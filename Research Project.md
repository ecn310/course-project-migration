## Research Question
(from Sep. 6 slideshow): What factors pushed Black and white migrants to the US South in the late 20th century? What parts of the south did they go to? What factors attracted Black and white migrants from the North to Southern destinations?

> > - from **Abstract** section: "Commonly used classifications of return and nonreturn migrants, based on birthplace and previous residence, do not accurately reflect the extent of familial and social ties behind recent Black migration to the southern United States. Analysis of the household context of individual migration confirms evidence from in-depth interviews with migrants that thousands of Black children and adults born outside the South are moving to the region as part of return migration. A reinterpretation of migration categories underscores social trends of overriding importance in explaining destination choices."

Interactive relationships that cause employment growth and migration to reinforce one another are probably operating, but these relationships are not well understood. They are the focus of this paper."

> > - “Black Economic Progress after Myrdal'' is an extensive, empirically tested paper that refers to the period of Economic change following the publication of Gunnar Myrdal's "An American Dilemma." This paper was a comprehensive analysis of the racial inequality and discrimination faced by Black Americans in the mid-20th century and outlined the stark disparities in economic, educational, and social opportunities between Black and white Americans. After the publication of Mydal’s paper, there were significant changes in the United States related to civil rights legislation, and laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were implemented to dismantle legal segregation and discrimination, and close the disproportionate wage gap between Black and White people. In this particular article, researchers observed that the wage gap narrowed substantially in 1940 and as growth diminished over time, the gap continued to close. This can be attributed through two crucial points: Education and Geographical Location.
> > - Education plays a crucial role in addressing these disparities. As Black individuals began to attain higher levels of education, such as high school diplomas, college degrees, or advanced degrees, they increased their earning potential significantly. Researchers reported that in 1940, after education improved in the black community, Black men were earning 50-55% as much as a white worker, and 70-80% in the 1980s and thereafter. This phenomenon is often observed as a narrowing of the wage gap between Black and white workers with similar levels of education. Educational attainment provided access to better job opportunities, higher-paying positions, and increased job security, all of which contributed to improved economic prospects for Black individuals. As these wage gains were transformative, it is important to consider that racial wage gaps persist, reflecting broader structural inequalities in the labor market that continue to be challenges in the pursuit of economic equity.
> > - Starting in 1910 and booming in the 40’s, the Great Migration, played a pivotal role in raising Black wages and improving economic prospects. In this time period, southern states were characterized by Jim Crow laws, racial segregation, and limited economic opportunities for Black individuals as they were often financially dependent on low bearing land and economically tied to sharecroppers. In contrast, the northern states were experiencing industrialization and urbanization, which created a growing demand for labor in factories, industries, and urban settings. As Black people moved northward, they entered an industrialized workforce as opposed to the South, that was technologically behind and characterized with low agricultural output. The influx of Black workers into northern cities also contributed to the growth of labor unions and the emergence of a more organized labor force. This led to improved working conditions and higher wages for many Black workers. Additionally, the increased demand for labor in the North created competition among employers for workers, which further pushed up wages.
