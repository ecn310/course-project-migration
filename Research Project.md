## Research Question
(from Sep. 6 slideshow): What factors pushed Black and white migrants to the US South in the late 20th century? What parts of the south did they go to? What factors attracted Black and white migrants from the North to Southern destinations?

> > - from **Abstract** section: "Commonly used classifications of return and nonreturn migrants, based on birthplace and previous residence, do not accurately reflect the extent of familial and social ties behind recent Black migration to the southern United States. Analysis of the household context of individual migration confirms evidence from in-depth interviews with migrants that thousands of Black children and adults born outside the South are moving to the region as part of return migration. A reinterpretation of migration categories underscores social trends of overriding importance in explaining destination choices."

Interactive relationships that cause employment growth and migration to reinforce one another are probably operating, but these relationships are not well understood. They are the focus of this paper."

> - **Summary/Important Points**
> > - Following the publication of Gunnar Myrdal's 'An American Dilemma,' "The 'Myrdal Effect on Black Economic Advancement' theory posits that a remarkable transformation occurred in the economic landscape for Black Americans in the mid-20th century. This theory is substantiated by a comprehensive empirical study that examines the racial inequality and discrimination faced by Black Americans during this time period, in the context of economics, education, and social opportunities comparable to their white counterparts>
> > - After Myrdal's influential publication, a wave of transformative changes swept through the United States, marked by the enactment of civil rights legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These legislative measures were designed to dismantle institutionalized segregation focusing specifically on the reduction of disproportionate wages between Black and white Americans. This shift in economic equality can be attributed to two key factors: education and geographical location. Through improved access to education and strategic geographical mobility, Black Americans were able to secure better economic prospects, ultimately contributing to the gradual closure of the wage gap between Black and white populations and the rise of their upward mobility.
> > - From this, the theory of education as a catalyst for economic growth emerges. As Black individuals began to attain higher levels of education, such as high school diplomas, college degrees, or advanced degrees, they increased their earning potential significantly. Researchers reported that in 1940, after education improved in the black community, Black men were earning 50-55% as much as a white worker, and 70-80% in the 1980s and thereafter. This phenomenon is often observed as a narrowing of the wage gap between Black and white workers with similar levels of education. Educational attainment provided access to better job opportunities, higher-paying positions, and increased job security, all of which contributed to improved economic prospects for Black individuals. It can be asserted that education in the Black community has transformative ramifications on average wages.
> > - Northward migration also became a leading cause in the increase of wages for Black Americans. Starting in 1910 and increasing exponentially in the 1940s, the Great Migration played a pivotal role in raising Black wages and improving economic prospects. Southern states were characterized by Jim Crow laws, racial segregation, and limited economic opportunities for Black individuals as they were often financially dependent on low bearing land and economically tied to sharecroppers. In contrast, the northern states were experiencing industrialization and urbanization, which created a growing demand for labor in factories, industries, and urban settings. As Black people moved northward, they entered an industrialized workforce as opposed to the South, that was technologically behind and characterized with low agricultural output. The influx of Black workers into northern cities also contributed to the growth of labor unions and the emergence of a more organized labor force. This led to improved working conditions and higher wages for many Black workers. Additionally, the increased demand for labor in the North created competition among employers for workers, which further pushed up wages.
