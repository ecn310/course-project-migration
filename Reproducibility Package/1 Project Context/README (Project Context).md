### README (Project Context)
This project exists in the context of a larger body of work conducted by Prof. Pearson, an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at Syracuse University. It was assigned as the semester-long project in ECN 310: Economics Research in Practice, an economics elective course for sophomore economics majors. We therefore received instructions from Prof. Pearson to guide us in modeling our project after his own work and feedback from Prof. Buzard, who was the instructor for the course, to guide us in our revisions.

#### Classwork
Throughout the course, various classwork and assignments were designed to help us learn about the research project, become more familiar with Stata, and make progress on our project. Some of those assignments that were directly relevant to the progress of the original version of the project (in the Fall 2023 semester) are included in this folder.
