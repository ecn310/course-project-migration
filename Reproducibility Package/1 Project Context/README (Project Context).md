### README (Project Context)
This project exists in the context of a larger body of work conducted by Prof. Pearson, an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at Syracuse University. It was assigned as the semester-long project in ECN 310: Economics Research in Practice, an economics elective course for sophomore economics majors. We therefore received instructions from Prof. Pearson to guide us in modeling our project after his own work and feedback from Prof. Buzard, who was the instructor for the course, to guide us in our revisions.

#### Classwork
Throughout the course, various classwork and assignments were designed to help us learn about the research project, become more familiar with Stata, and make progress on our project. Some of those assignments that were directly relevant to the progress of the original version of the project (in the Fall 2023 semester) are included in this folder.

#### Other relevant background
A very brief summary of the purpose and goals of this project is included in the README file on the [home page](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-migration/tree/main). Other important details to note follow:

##### Definitions of North and South
We define the North to include the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont. We define the South to include the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

##### Return vs nonreturn migration
Migrants to the South include return and nonreturn migrants. Return migrants are people who have previously lived in the South. Nonreturn migrants are people who have not previously lived in the south. This project focuses only on nonreturn migrants, using the number of people who were born in the North and now live in the South to obtain the "migration rate."
