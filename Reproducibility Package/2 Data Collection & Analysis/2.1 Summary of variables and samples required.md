#### 2.1 Summary of variables and samples required
Following Professor Pearson's instructions, we were to collect data from IPUMS, a website that provides global census and survey data. For our purposes, we used the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) page.

##### Variables
The following variables were used in our research:
###### Race (RACE)
Description
###### Birthplace (BPL)
Description
###### State of residence (STATEFIP)
Description
###### Total family income (FTOTINC)
Description
###### Consumer price index multiplier (CPI99)
Description

##### Samples
As is stated in the files in "1 Project Context," we were to use the following samples:
- 1950
- 1960
- 1970
- 1980
- 1990
- 2000
- 2010
- 2020

However, when conducting the data analysis portion of the project, we were unable to collect the median family income data for the 1950 sample. When the corresponding do-file was run in Stata, the 1950 data showed numbers so large they couldn't be properly displayed by Stata. Therefore, this sample was removed from analysis for the rest of the project. This is mentioned in the revised report.
