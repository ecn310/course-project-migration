### 2.4 Data analysis and conclusions
Raw data collected from data analysis was recorded in the Excel workbook [July 2024 Data Analysis](https://sumailsyr-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/qwu102_syr_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD3442703-9F83-49F3-8F44-E902CEF2211C%7D&file=July%202024%20Data%20Analysis.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true), which is located inside the [Working Folder](https://sumailsyr-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/qwu102_syr_edu/ElFttFZHsVlEp0PZXKwhwTgBf4TW_41Wh42sCX_AVBQrvg?e=3Szf2H) (link and description on home page).

#### Tables and graphs
- We recorded the data in two large tables, one for median family income and one for migration rate, on **Sheet 1** of the Excel workbook. For each table, the columns were the different sample years and the rows were the three different populations. From each of these tables, we created a line graph with markers, which are included in the [report](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-migration/tree/main/Reproducibility%20Package/3%20Report).
- **Sheet 2** of the workbook is scrap work used to eyeball the relationship between median family income or migration rate and time for each individula population. Preliminary conclusions were drawn here, but the proper analysis comes from the composite graphs and correlation coefficients on **Sheet 1**.

#### Correlation coefficients
For each of the three populations, we found the correlation coefficients between their median family income and migration rate:

| Overall  | Black | White |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0.6908  | 0.7870  | 0.7426 |

This work was done and recorded in the Excel workbook as well.
