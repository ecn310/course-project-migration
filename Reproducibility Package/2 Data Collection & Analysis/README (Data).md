### Data Collection & Analysis
This folder/section contains the necessary information and materials needed for a person with no prior knowledge of the project to recreate the steps taken to collect, access, code, visualize, and draw conclusions from the data.

#### 2.1 Summary of variables and samples required
This document contains a link to the website from which the data was collected ([IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)). It also includes for each variable a shortened description lifted directly from IPUMS.

#### 2.2 Downloading and accessing data files from IPUMS
This document details the process through which I downloaded and prepared the data and text files so that they could be accessed and used in Stata. It also contains a link to where my copies of the data and do-files are stored in OneDrive.

#### 2.3 Data work
This is a copy of the code I added or modified in each of the text/do-files in order to generate the data I needed. It contains the same information that can be found in the Appendix of the [report](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-migration/tree/main/Reproducibility%20Package/3%20Report).

#### 2.4 Data analysis and conclusions
This document contains a link to the [Excel workbook](https://sumailsyr-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/qwu102_syr_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD3442703-9F83-49F3-8F44-E902CEF2211C%7D&file=July%202024%20Data%20Analysis.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) in which I recorded and analyzed the data, as well as links to the images of the graphs I generated from said data.
