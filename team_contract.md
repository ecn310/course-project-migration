Ground Rules:
1) Show up to class and communiciate if you are unable to complete a given task
2) Follow our created timeline for checkpoints throughout the semester
3) Submit work on time according to said timeline
4) Allow 2-3 days for revisions after changes are requested
5) Allocate time outside of classroom for meetings and come prepared; If you are unabel to make a reason do communicate via text
6) Text message will be primary mode of communication
7) 

We, Karyne and     ,agree upon these tenets for the remainder of the semester.
