## Ground Rules
1) Show up to class (communicate if you won't be there)
2) Communiciate if you are unable to complete a given task
3) Follow our created timeline for checkpoints throughout the semester
4) Submit work on time according to said timeline
5) Allow 2-3 days for revisions after changes are requested
6) Allocate time outside of classroom for meetings and come prepared; if you are unable to make a meeting, communicate the reason via text
7) Text message will be primary mode of communication

We, Karyne and Mars, agree upon these tenets for the remainder of the semester.
