# Course Project: Question / Literature / Theory
Due on **Wednesday, September 27, 2023--end of the day**

## Requirements
### A clear statement of your research question
- It can be what the faculty member said, or Prof. Buzard's summary of it. Just be clear about where it came from and how it changed.
- [Example](https://github.com/ecn310/exercises/blob/main/lit_review_assignment1_example.md)

### A list of at least five scholarly sources
- At least two beyond what your faculty sponsor shared
- Choose a citation style (see last page of Greenlaw Ch. 3)--match what's used in something your sponsor shared
- Include a URL to each paper, if possible. Otherwise, upload a PDF to a folder called "Lit Review" on your project repo.

#### For each source:
- Provide a full citation. Use the Google Scholar shortcut.
- Explain how you found the source.
- Include any theory/conceptual framework and research hypothesis (use direct quotes if you want, but just put them in quotes)

### Add to your documentation wiki
- that you worked on lit review today, where the material is, and what you accomplished
